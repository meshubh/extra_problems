1.)Given two strings which are unsigned integer numbers (in string format). Write an adder to add the numbers. Lenghts of both can be different.
2.)An unsigned number Q is formed by taking input P which is an unsigned integer in string format, K: number of times P repeated to form Q. Write a function to find whether the number Q is divisible by 3 or not
3.)Given a unsigned number as a string input  write a function to find whether the number is divisible by 11 or not
